Explain your view.\n\nStudent Response: I believe social media has both significant positive and negative impacts on society, but the negatives currently outweigh the positives. On the positive side, social media has democratized information sharing, allowed marginalized voices to be heard, and enabled people to maintain connections across geographical distances. It's been crucial for organizing social movements and providing platforms for education and business. However, the negative impacts are substantial. Firstly, social media has contributed to the spread of misinformation and polarization, as algorithms tend to create echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs rather than exposing people to diverse perspectives. Secondly, it has been linked to mental health issues, particularly among young people, due to constant comparison with others and addictive usage patterns. Finally, social media has raised serious concerns about privacy and data manipulation. I think the key is developing better regulation and digital literacy to maximize the benefits while minimizing the harms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

I believe that deep, long-term study, perhaps through books and language learning, combined with meaningful relationships with people from other cultures, provides a more complete understanding. Travel often gives only a surface-level view - you see tourist attractions and restaurants, but you don't truly understand the daily struggles, values, and complexities of a culture. For example, spending a week in Paris doesn't teach you about French work culture, family dynamics, or social issues. However, studying French literature, history, and forming friendships with French people can provide deeper insights than brief tourism. Additionally, traveling can be expensive and inaccessible to many people, making it an unfair \"\"best\"\" method for cultural learning."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

My primary reason is that this option best demonstrates my analytical thinking skills. When reviewing a novel, I need to consider multiple elements like character development, plot structure, and themes, which shows my ability to think critically and organize complex ideas. Additionally, discussing a novel allows me to share personal insights and interpretations, making the presentation more engaging for my audience.

Other people prefer not to create such records. Which approach do you prefer and why?\n\nStudent Response: I prefer not to create detailed records of my experiences on social networking sites. First, I value my privacy and want to maintain control over my personal information. When you upload pictures and details about your life online, you lose control over who sees that information and how it might be used in the future. Employers, strangers, or even criminals could access and misuse this data. Second, I believe that constantly documenting experiences for social media can actually diminish the quality of those experiences.

I enjoy the process of looking at what ingredients I have available and imagining how they might work together to create something delicious and unique. For instance, I might combine leftover roasted vegetables with pasta and create an entirely new sauce based on what's in my pantry. This approach makes cooking feel like an art form rather than just following directions. Secondly, experimenting helps me become a more skilled and intuitive cook.

For instance, my homemade pasta sauce is much healthier than a store-bought one. Secondly, I find cooking to be a very relaxing and creative activity.

When I make a mistake and then figure out how to correct it, the lesson becomes deeply ingrained in my memory. For example, when I was learning to cook, I followed recipes exactly at first, but I only became a confident cook after I made some mistakes—like burning food or using too much salt—and learned to adjust. These mistakes taught me to understand cooking principles rather than just memorize steps.

In a shared house, there can be a lot of noise and distractions from other students – people coming and going, having conversations, playing music, or watching TV. This would make it difficult for me to concentrate on my coursework. Additionally, having my own space allows me to maintain my preferred study schedule. I often study late at night or early in the morning when it's quiet, and I wouldn't want to disturb roommates or be disturbed by their schedules. Privacy is also important to me. In a private apartment, I can have personal phone calls, video chat with family, or simply relax without feeling like I'm being watched or judged by others. While a shared house might be more social and potentially less expensive, I believe that my academic success should be the priority during my university years.

Spending time outdoors encourages physical activity like walking, hiking, or sports, which helps combat the sedentary lifestyle that many people lead today. Additionally, sunlight provides essential vitamin D, which is crucial for bone health and immune function. Many people, especially those who work indoors all day, are deficient in this vitamin. Secondly, outdoor time significantly benefits mental health. Nature has been scientifically proven to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. The Japanese practice of \"\"forest bathing\"\" has shown measurable improvements in mood and mental clarity.

Secondly, being outdoors helps me relax and reduce stress. There's something about being in nature – whether it's a park, beach, or hiking trail – that helps me clear my mind and forget about academic pressures. The natural environment provides a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Additionally, outdoor activities offer more variety and excitement than indoor activities. I can try different sports, explore new places, or simply enjoy the changing seasons. Each outdoor experience is unique and often provides opportunities to meet new people or spend quality time with friends.

First of all, students only attend universities for a few years, but the effects of budget decisions can last for decades.  As a result, students might make decisions that seem good in the short term but are actually bad for the university in the long term.  For example, students might want to spend money on new recreational facilities instead of academic programs, but this could hurt the university's reputation and make degrees less valuable.  Secondly, students don't have enough experience with financial management to make good decisions about budgets.  University budgets are very complicated, and they require a lot of knowledge about things like investments, taxes, and regulations.  Students are focused on their studies, and they don't have time to learn about these complicated financial matters."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

I disagree that TV negatively impacts kids and should therefore be avoided. First, there are many educational programs on TV that can help children learn about science, history, and other subjects. Shows like documentaries and educational cartoons can be very informative and engaging for young minds. Second, TV can be a great source of entertainment and relaxation for children after a long day at school. Just like adults, kids need some downtime, and watching their favorite shows can help them unwind and de-stress.Finally, watching TV together can be a bonding experience for families. When parents and children watch programs together, it creates opportunities for discussion and shared experiences that can strengthen family relationships. Of course, I think it's important to monitor what children watch and limit screen time, but completely avoiding TV would mean missing out on these potential benefits.

First of all, it will help you to make more money when you're  older. For example, when my brother and I were children growing up in New York, we learned both English and Mandarin. Now, he works for the Bank of Shanghai, earning over 200,000 dollars a year. In addition, learning a second language is great for a child's brain development and I think it'll help them learn other languages faster.

Others feel that television is one of many ways a child can learn. Which do you believe?\n\nStudent Response: This is actually an interesting topic that I have discussed before with my friends. I disagree that TV negatively impacts kids and should therefore be avoided. First, there are many educational programs out there, especially for young children. I remember when I was younger, I was allowed to watch Dora the Explorer every day. From that show, I learned the foundations of the Spanish language. Secondly, while there are some programs that are not kid-friendly, the television is an invention that is never going to go away. Children should not be shunned from it, but rather taught how to use the TV responsibly. Embracing TV is the best way to prepare kids for adulthood, when they can spend their time watching whatever they want."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

For instance, I was responsible for cooking breakfast for my little brother every day before we went to school when we were both kids.  As a result, when I went away to college as a teenager I stayed really healthy because I could cook my own meals instead of always going out for fast food like my friends and classmates. Secondly, parents and children can do household chores together and this gives them a chance to bond.  You know, as they work on things like cleaning dishes or cooking food they can chat, and the kids might open up about what's going on in their lives."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Secondly, while there are some programs that are not kid-friendly, the television is an invention that is never going to go away.

The primary reason is that fiction engages the imagination and emotions in ways that nonfiction typically doesn't. Stories with compelling characters and exciting plots naturally draw readers in and make them want to continue reading. For example, when I was in school, I would eagerly read novels like \"\"Harry Potter\"\" or \"\"The Hunger Games\"\" in my free time, but I often struggled to get through history textbooks or science articles. The second reason is that fiction allows readers to escape from reality and experience different worlds and perspectives. This escapist quality makes reading feel more like entertainment than work, which is especially important for young students who might otherwise view reading as a chore. Fiction helps develop a love for reading that can then extend to other types of texts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

For example, booking flights and hotels for a trip in advance saves money and avoids problems. However, within that plan, it's great to be spontaneous.

The primary reason is that an engaging professor makes learning enjoyable and memorable. When a professor is passionate about their subject, uses creative teaching methods, and connects the material to real-world applications, I find myself naturally motivated to study harder and dig deeper into the topic. The knowledge I gain from such classes stays with me much longer than information I memorize just to pass a test. Additionally, strict grading standards actually benefit students in the long run. They push you to develop better study habits, time management skills, and a thorough understanding of the material. While it might mean working harder for good grades, the rigorous standards ensure that you truly master the subject matter, which will serve you well in future courses and your career."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Firstly, it often replaces deep, meaningful face-to-face conversations with superficial online interactions. People might have hundreds of social media friends but feel lonely because these connections lack emotional depth and authentic intimacy. For instance, many young people prefer texting over calling or meeting in person, which limits their ability to develop strong interpersonal skills.

While some games or excessive play can be harmful, many video games have positive effects. Firstly, many games are excellent for developing problem-solving skills and strategic thinking. For example, puzzle games or strategy games require players to think several steps ahead and consider multiple variables. Secondly, multiplayer games can actually improve social skills and teamwork. Many online games require coordination and communication with other players to succeed. Finally, educational games can make learning more engaging and effective than traditional methods.

Firstly, experiences create lasting memories that actually become more valuable and meaningful over time. When I spend money on a trip to a new country, a cooking class, or a concert, those memories stay with me forever and often become stories I share with others for years to come. For example, the money I spent on a backpacking trip through Europe five years ago still brings me joy every time I think about it, whereas I can barely remember most of the clothes or gadgets I bought that same year. Secondly, experiences contribute to personal growth and learning in ways that material possessions simply cannot. Traveling exposes me to new cultures, taking classes teaches me new skills, and attending cultural events broadens my perspective. These experiences shape who I am as a person, while material items tend to lose their novelty quickly and often end up unused or forgotten."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The main reason is the unique energy and atmosphere that only live performances can provide. There's something magical about being in the same space as the artists, feeling the music vibrate through your body, and sharing that experience with hundreds or thousands of other fans. The collective excitement and emotional connection creates an atmosphere that simply cannot be replicated through headphones or speakers. Additionally, live concerts offer spontaneity and uniqueness that recorded music lacks. Each performance is different - artists might improvise, interact with the audience, or play rare songs that aren't on their albums. I love knowing that I'm witnessing something that will never happen exactly the same way again.

Use reasons and examples to explain your opinion.\n\nStudent Response: In my opinion, it's better to take your time to decide carefully, especially for important matters. The primary reason is that careful deliberation leads to better outcomes and fewer regrets. When we rush into decisions, we often overlook crucial factors or fail to consider all available options. Taking time allows us to gather relevant information, weigh pros and cons, and think through potential consequences. For example, when I was choosing which university to attend, I spent several months researching different programs, visiting campuses, and talking to current students. This thorough process helped me select a school that was truly the right fit for my goals and personality. The second reason is that careful decision-making builds confidence and reduces anxiety.

The main reason is that the primary purpose of education is to learn and grow, not just to get good grades. A challenging course pushes me out of my comfort zone and forces me to develop new skills and ways of thinking. For example, a difficult physics class might be tough, but it would deepen my problem-solving abilities.

The most important reason is that this approach fosters self-discipline and responsibility, which are crucial skills for university and for life. When a teacher trusts me to manage my own time and complete my work, I learn to be more organized and self-motivated. Secondly, I enjoy the freedom to explore topics in my own way.

First, this requirement ensures students receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for the complexities of modern life. In today's interconnected world, professionals need to understand various fields to be effective. For example, an engineer who understands psychology and communication will be better at working with teams and explaining technical concepts to non-experts. Second, exposure to diverse subjects can help students discover new interests and career paths they might never have considered.

In an effort to give their kids every advantage, many parents fill their children's schedules with countless activities like music lessons, sports, tutoring, and various clubs. While these activities can be beneficial, over-scheduling leaves children with no free time to develop independence, creativity, or simply to rest and recharge. This approach can lead to stress, burnout, and children who become dependent on constant external structure rather than learning to manage their own time and discover their own interests. Additionally, it can strain family relationships because there's no time for relaxed, spontaneous family interactions that are crucial for emotional bonding."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The primary reason is that these skills are essential for independent adult life, yet many students graduate without knowing how to manage their finances, cook nutritious meals, or handle basic household tasks. This leaves young adults unprepared for the realities of living on their own and can lead to serious problems like debt, poor health, and stress. For example, many college students survive on fast food because they never learned to cook, which is both expensive and unhealthy. Secondly, not all families can or do teach these skills at home. Some parents work multiple jobs and don't have time, while others may lack these skills themselves. Schools can ensure that all students, regardless of their family background, receive this essential knowledge. Teaching practical skills would better prepare graduates for real-world challenges and help them become more self-sufficient adults."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The first reason is that it helps them develop a sense of competence and self-esteem. When children successfully complete tasks like setting the table, doing laundry, or organizing their rooms, they feel proud and capable. This builds their confidence for handling larger responsibilities as they grow older. Secondly, household responsibilities teach practical life skills that they'll need as adults. My younger sister learned to do laundry and cook simple meals when she was ten, and now as a college student, she's much more independent than her peers who never had chores. Finally, sharing responsibilities strengthens family bonds as everyone contributes to the household's wellbeing, creating a sense of teamwork and mutual support."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

While it allows us to connect with people across distances, I believe it has actually harmed the quality of our interactions. Firstly, social media promotes superficial communication rather than meaningful conversations. People tend to share brief updates or react with simple emojis rather than engaging in deep, thoughtful discussions. For instance, instead of having a genuine conversation about someone's life experiences, we might just \"\"like\"\" their post and move on. Secondly, social media can create misunderstandings because it lacks the non-verbal cues that are essential for effective communication. Without facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language, messages can be misinterpreted, leading to conflicts or confusion that wouldn't occur in face-to-face conversations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Explain your choice.\n\nStudent Response: I think it's better for college students to attend school full-time, if they are able. The main reason is that full-time enrollment allows for deeper immersion in the academic experience and faster progression toward degree completion. When students take a full course load, they can build stronger connections between different subjects and develop a more comprehensive understanding of their field of study. The intensive nature of full-time study also helps maintain academic momentum and keeps students engaged with the material. For example, a student studying biology full-time can immediately apply concepts learned in chemistry class to their biology coursework, creating a richer educational experience. Additionally, full-time students have better access to campus resources and opportunities. They can participate more fully in research projects, internships, study groups, and extracurricular activities that enhance their education and career prospects. Full-time status also typically provides access to better financial aid packages and allows students to graduate sooner, reducing the total cost of education and enabling them to enter the workforce earlier."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The primary reason is that family relationships are built on a foundation of unconditional love and long-term commitment. Unlike friendships, which can change or fade over time, family bonds typically endure throughout a person's life, creating a stable source of guidance and support. Young adults are more likely to trust and seriously consider advice from people who have demonstrated consistent care for their wellbeing over many years. For example, when I was deciding on my college major, I ultimately chose to follow my parents' guidance rather than my friends' suggestions because I knew my parents understood my strengths and had my best interests at heart.

Which space do you recommend to add? (1) study room (2) game room (3) meeting room.\n\nStudent Response: I would recommend adding a dedicated study room to the dormitory. The main reason is academic necessity. Many students struggle to find quiet, focused study environments in their dorm rooms due to roommate activities, noise from hallways, or general distractions. A dedicated study room would provide a controlled environment specifically designed for concentration and learning. For example, during finals week last semester, I had to walk to the library every time I needed complete silence, which wasted valuable study time. Additionally, a study room would benefit the entire dorm community by reducing conflicts between roommates who have different study schedules and habits.

Explain your opinion using specific examples.\n\nStudent Response: I strongly agree that all students should be required to learn a second language. The first reason is that it provides significant cognitive benefits. Research has shown that bilingual individuals have enhanced problem-solving skills, better multitasking abilities, and improved memory function. Learning a second language literally reshapes the brain, creating new neural pathways that enhance overall cognitive performance. For instance, studies have demonstrated that bilingual students often perform better in mathematics and standardized tests compared to their monolingual peers. The second reason is that it prepares students for an increasingly globalized world. In today's interconnected economy, the ability to communicate in multiple languages opens up tremendous opportunities for international business, travel, and cultural exchange. For example, many multinational companies now require employees to be proficient in at least two languages, and students who develop these skills early have a significant advantage in the job market."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The process of failing, reflecting, and correcting teaches us lessons that stick with us much longer than theoretical knowledge. When I failed my first job interview because I was unprepared, I learned the importance of research and practice in a way that no advice could have taught me. Secondly, avoiding mistakes entirely limits our growth and innovation. If we only take safe, guaranteed paths, we miss opportunities to discover new solutions and push boundaries. Many great discoveries and innovations came from \"\"mistakes\"\" or unexpected results.

Use details to support your choice.\n\nStudent Response: I would rather live in a country with four seasons than in a tropical climate. The primary reason is the variety and richness that seasonal changes bring to life. Each season offers unique experiences and activities - skiing and cozy fireplaces in winter, fresh blooms and mild temperatures in spring, outdoor festivals and swimming in summer, and beautiful foliage and harvest celebrations in fall. This constant change keeps life interesting and gives me something to look forward to throughout the year. Additionally, I find that seasonal changes create a natural rhythm and help mark the passage of time in a meaningful way. The transition from one season to another feels like turning pages in a book, with each chapter offering its own character and mood. While tropical climates are pleasant and consistent, I think I would eventually find the sameness boring and would miss the anticipation and excitement that comes with seasonal transitions. The variety of four seasons also means I can enjoy a wider range of foods, activities, and fashion choices throughout the year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

While it's enjoyable to do things we are good at, it is more important for personal growth to take part in things we are not good at. Firstly, challenging ourselves with difficult activities helps us develop new skills and discover hidden talents. If we only stick to our strengths, we limit our potential for growth.

By working with different populations - whether helping at food banks, reading to elderly residents, or tutoring younger students - teenagers develop compassion and awareness of community needs. This exposure to diverse experiences helps them become more well-rounded, caring citizens. Secondly, volunteering provides practical experience and skills that benefit students' future careers and college applications. Students learn teamwork, communication, and leadership skills while also exploring potential career interests. For example, a student volunteering at a hospital might discover an interest in healthcare. Finally, mandatory volunteering ensures that all students, regardless of background, have these valuable experiences.

Provide examples.\n\nStudent Response: I strongly agree that success is determined more by hard work than by talent. While talent can give someone a head start, it's useless without dedication and effort. The primary reason is that hard work develops skills and expertise that talent alone cannot provide. For example, many naturally gifted athletes never reach professional levels because they don't put in the training, while less talented athletes who work extremely hard often surpass them. Additionally, hard work builds character traits like persistence, discipline, and resilience that are essential for long-term success. When faced with obstacles, people who rely only on talent often give up, while hard workers find ways to overcome challenges. Finally, hard work is something everyone can control, regardless of their natural abilities. While we can't choose our talents, we can choose our effort level, making hard work a more reliable path to success than hoping for natural gifts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The main reason is that privacy is essential for healthy development and building trust between parents and children. When children feel that their private communications are constantly monitored, they may become secretive and less likely to communicate openly with their parents about important issues. This can damage the parent-child relationship in the long term. However, parents do have a responsibility to protect their children, so if there are clear warning signs of dangerous behavior, intervention may be necessary.

Explain your opinion with details.\n\nStudent Response: I agree that people live healthier lives today than they did 100 years ago. The most significant reason is the tremendous advancement in medical technology and healthcare. A century ago, diseases that are easily treatable today, such as tuberculosis, polio, and many bacterial infections, were often fatal. The development of antibiotics, vaccines, and sophisticated medical equipment has dramatically reduced mortality rates and increased life expectancy. For example, the average life expectancy in the United States has increased from about 54 years in 1920 to nearly 80 years today. Additionally, we have much better understanding of nutrition and disease prevention, allowing people to make more informed choices about their health. The second reason is improved living conditions and sanitation. Modern water treatment systems, food safety regulations, and building codes have virtually eliminated many diseases that were common 100 years ago. People today have access to clean drinking water, safe food handling practices, and proper waste disposal systems that significantly reduce the risk of infectious diseases."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

And I think we always do a better job the second time around.  That's why I think it's better for us to make mistakes and learn from them. Secondly, mistakes help us become more skilled and confident.  For example, when I was a kid, I made a lot of mistakes when I was cooking, and I thought I was terrible at it.  But I kept trying and I kept making mistakes. And in the end, I learned so much from those mistakes that I became a pretty good chef.

Give reasons to support your opinion.\n\nStudent Response: No, schools should not stop teaching handwriting. Firstly, handwriting has been shown to have cognitive benefits that typing cannot replicate. Research in neuroscience demonstrates that the physical act of forming letters by hand activates different areas of the brain compared to typing, particularly regions associated with learning and memory. When students write by hand, they tend to process and retain information more effectively. For example, studies have shown that students who take notes by hand during lectures generally perform better on tests than those who type their notes, because the slower pace of handwriting forces them to be more selective and thoughtful about what they record. Secondly, handwriting skills remain practically important in many real-world situations. Despite our digital age, there are still numerous occasions when handwriting is necessary or preferred, such as signing legal documents, filling out forms in medical offices, or taking quick notes when technology isn't available. Additionally, handwriting is a form of personal expression and cultural heritage that connects us to human history and individuality in ways that standardized typing cannot."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The goal of our interactions should be to help and support others, not just to share facts. Kindness allows us to be truthful in ways that are constructive rather than harmful. For example, if a friend asks about a performance that wasn't very good, a kind person might focus on encouraging improvement rather than harshly criticizing. However, this doesn't mean being dishonest or fake. True kindness often involves honest communication delivered with empathy and compassion. There are certainly situations where honesty is crucial - like in professional settings, legal matters, or when someone's safety is at risk. But in most daily interactions, finding ways to be both honest and kind creates the best outcomes for relationships and society. The challenge is learning to speak truthfully while considering the impact of our words on others."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

This can reduce bullying and make students from lower-income families feel more comfortable. The second reason is that uniforms can improve discipline and focus. Getting dressed in a uniform each morning can put students in a more serious, academic mindset, and it simplifies the morning routine, reducing distractions related to clothing choices and allowing students to focus on their studies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

For one, when I was a student, any time there was an exam coming up, I would cram.

Firstly, reading allows me to go at my own pace and absorb the information more thoughtfully. I can slow down to process complex information or reread important sections to make sure I understand them fully. Television news, on the other hand, moves at a fixed pace that I can't control. Secondly, written articles typically provide more detailed and comprehensive coverage of issues.

I love it for two main reasons. First, it has an incredibly clever and unpredictable storyline that explores complex social themes. The movie tells the story of two families from completely different social classes, and the way their lives become intertwined is both fascinating and disturbing. Director Bong Joon-ho masterfully uses symbolism throughout the film - from the physical levels of the houses representing social hierarchy to the recurring motif of stairs and basements. The plot keeps you guessing until the very end, with multiple unexpected twists that completely change your understanding of the characters and their motivations. Second, the film's universal themes make it incredibly powerful and relevant worldwide. While it's specifically about Korean society, the issues it explores - economic inequality, class conflict, and the struggles of working-class families - resonate globally. The movie doesn't present simple villains or heroes, but rather shows how economic systems can corrupt relationships and force people into desperate situations. The fact that it won the Academy Award for Best Picture proves that great storytelling can transcend cultural and language barriers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

With audiobooks, I'm stuck with the narrator's pace, which might not match my preferences. Secondly, I find it much easier to remember details when I read. I can flip back through the pages to check character names, plot points, or previous events, which helps me keep track of complex storylines. While audiobooks are convenient for multitasking, like during commutes or while exercising, I feel that I get a richer, more engaged experience from traditional reading."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The first and most important reason is basic human dignity and the right to privacy. Celebrities are human beings who deserve the same fundamental respect for their personal lives as anyone else.

For instance, we've seen how invasive media coverage has led to mental health struggles and even tragic outcomes for some celebrities. The second reason is that focusing on celebrities' private lives distracts from more meaningful public discourse. When media attention is consumed by gossip and personal scandals, it takes away from coverage of important social issues, artistic achievements, and substantive contributions that celebrities might be making to society. This shift toward sensationalism ultimately diminishes the quality of public conversation and cultural understanding."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

What is your opinion and why?\n\nStudent Response: I believe that children should be allowed to make the decision themselves, with guidance from their parents. The main reason is that forcing a child to do something they have lost passion for can turn a potentially enjoyable activity into a hated chore. This can create resentment and might even turn them off music permanently. True skill and artistry come from intrinsic motivation, not from force. Secondly, allowing a child to make this choice teaches them valuable life skills.

Explain your viewpoint.\n\nStudent Response: I disagree. I believe parents should supervise and limit the TV programs their children watch. Firstly, many TV shows contain content that is inappropriate for children, including violence, sexual content, strong language, and disturbing themes that can negatively affect their psychological development. Children don't have the maturity to process such content properly, and exposure to it can lead to behavioral problems, nightmares, or desensitization to violence. Secondly, unlimited TV watching can interfere with important childhood activities like homework, physical exercise, social interaction, and creative play. When children spend too much time in front of screens, they miss out on experiences that are crucial for their physical, emotional, and intellectual development. Parents need to set boundaries and choose age-appropriate programming that can be both entertaining and educational. This doesn't mean being overly restrictive, but rather being thoughtful about what children are consuming through media."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Support your answer with examples.\n\nStudent Response: I completely agree that making mistakes is one of the most effective ways to learn. Firstly, mistakes provide direct and memorable feedback. When you make an error, the consequences are often immediate and clear, which helps you understand exactly what went wrong and why. This type of experiential learning is much more powerful than simply reading about something or being told what not to do. For example, when I was learning to drive, I once failed to check my blind spot and nearly caused an accident. That mistake made a much stronger impression on me than any driving manual could have, and I never made that error again. Secondly, the process of correcting mistakes requires deep thinking and problem-solving. When something goes wrong, you have to analyze what happened, identify the root cause, and figure out how to fix it. This active engagement with the material leads to better understanding and retention than passive learning methods. Mistakes also build resilience and teach us that failure is a normal part of the learning process."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Firstly, print offers a unique sensory and tactile experience that digital formats cannot replicate. Many people enjoy the physical sensation of turning pages, the smell of books, and the ability to easily flip through pages to reference earlier sections. This tactile experience creates a deeper connection between the reader and the material. Secondly, print materials don't depend on technology or electricity, making them more reliable and accessible. You can read a book anywhere without worrying about battery life, internet connection, or device malfunctions. Additionally, research suggests that people often comprehend and retain information better when reading from physical books compared to screens. While digital formats are convenient and will continue to coexist with print, I believe there will always be a significant segment of the population that prefers the traditional reading experience."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Firstly, it keeps me motivated and mentally engaged throughout the entire workday. When there are multiple deadlines, urgent projects, and constant challenges, I feel energized and focused rather than bored or sluggish. For example, when I worked as a server in a busy restaurant during peak hours, the constant flow of orders and customer requests kept me alert and efficient. I thrived on the adrenaline and sense of accomplishment that came from handling multiple tasks simultaneously. Secondly, fast-paced environments typically offer more opportunities for rapid skill development and career advancement.

This accelerated growth is much more appealing to me than the stagnation that can occur in slower work environments."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Even during my most stressful periods, like during university exams or when I was job hunting, she could always make me laugh with her funny stories or silly impressions of our relatives. She has this amazing ability to find humor in everyday situations and help me see the lighter side of problems that seem overwhelming. Her positive energy is infectious, and spending time with her always leaves me feeling more hopeful and relaxed. Second, she's been my most trusted advisor and emotional support throughout my life. When I was struggling with choosing my university major, she spent hours listening to my concerns and helping me think through the pros and cons of different options. She never judges me or tries to impose her opinions, but instead asks thoughtful questions that help me discover my own answers. She also shares her own experiences and mistakes openly, which makes me feel comfortable being vulnerable with her.

Online photos can be misleading, and returning items is often inconvenient and time-consuming.

For example, by blocking out specific study times, I avoid procrastination. Secondly, a routine is better for my well-being.

Firstly, being a good follower requires valuable skills like active listening, collaboration, and the ability to support others' visions. In many situations, the best outcome comes from having people who can contribute ideas and work effectively under guidance rather than everyone trying to lead. For example, in orchestras, musicians must follow the conductor's lead to create beautiful music together. Secondly, different situations call for different roles. Sometimes the person with the most expertise or relevant experience should lead, regardless of their usual role. A good leader should also know when to step back and follow others. Finally, constant leadership can be exhausting and stressful, while being a follower can allow people to focus on their strengths and contribute meaningfully without the pressure of decision-making responsibility."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

In an effort to give their kids every possible advantage, parents often sign them up for too many activities—sports, music lessons, tutoring, and academic camps. While these activities can be beneficial, when children have no free time to just play, relax, or explore their own interests, it can lead to stress and burnout. Secondly, many parents fail to allow their children to make mistakes and learn from them. They hover constantly, solving problems for their kids rather than teaching them problem-solving skills.

Firstly, a kind teacher creates a safe and supportive classroom environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and participating in discussions. When students aren't afraid of being judged or criticized, they're more willing to take risks in their learning, which leads to better understanding and retention. For instance, I had a math teacher in high school who was always patient and encouraging, and because of her approach, I felt confident enough to ask for help when I didn't understand concepts. Secondly, friendly teachers build positive relationships with their students, which motivates students to work harder and engage more deeply with the material. When students feel that their teacher cares about them as individuals, they're more likely to put in extra effort and take their studies seriously."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Firstly, learning and intellectual growth have no expiration date, and mature students often bring unique advantages to their education. Older students typically have clearer goals, stronger motivation, and better time management skills than traditional college-age students. They approach education with real-world experience that enhances their understanding of theoretical concepts. For example, a working professional returning to study business can connect classroom theories directly to their workplace experiences, creating richer learning opportunities. Secondly, today's economy increasingly values continuous learning and skill development. Many industries evolve rapidly, requiring workers to update their knowledge throughout their careers. A university degree later in life can open new career paths, enable career advancement, or simply provide personal fulfillment.

Firstly, they provide emotional and spiritual enrichment that enhances the quality of human life. Art and music have the unique ability to evoke powerful emotions, inspire hope, and offer comfort during difficult times. Throughout history, artists and musicians have helped people process trauma, celebrate joy, and find meaning in their experiences. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, musicians who performed virtual concerts and artists who created uplifting works provided much-needed emotional support to millions of people who were isolated and struggling. Secondly, artists and musicians serve as important social commentators and agents of change. They often address societal issues, challenge injustices, and give voice to marginalized communities. Through their work, they can raise awareness about important causes and inspire people to take action. Musicians like Bob Dylan and visual artists like Banksy have used their platforms to comment on war, inequality, and political corruption, influencing public opinion and social movements."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Support your answer with specific reasons.\n\nStudent Response: I strongly disagree; I believe students learn much better in small classes. The most important reason is the increased opportunity for individual attention from the teacher. In a small class, teachers can identify each student's strengths and weaknesses and provide personalized feedback and support. They can also adjust their teaching pace to ensure all students understand the material before moving on. For instance, in my high school calculus class of only 12 students, our teacher could work individually with each of us when we struggled with difficult concepts. The second reason is increased student participation. In smaller classes, students have more opportunities to ask questions, engage in discussions, and participate in activities. They can't hide in the back or remain silent as easily as they can in large lecture halls. This active participation leads to better understanding and retention of the material."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

This skill helps them navigate conflicts peacefully, work well in teams, and contribute positively to their communities. Secondly, parents should teach their children resilience and perseverance.

First of all, it will help you to make more money when you're older. For example, when my brother and I were children growing up in New York, we learned both English and Mandarin. Now, he works for the Bank of Shanghai, earning over 200,000 dollars a year. In addition, learning a second language is great for a child's brain development and I think it'll help them learn other languages faster.

To buy the newly-released e-product as soon as possible or to wait for a while before you buy it?\n\nStudent Response: I prefer to wait for a while before buying a newly-released electronic product. Firstly, new products often have technical issues or design flaws that aren't discovered until they reach mass market conditions. Early adopters frequently encounter bugs, compatibility problems, or manufacturing defects that companies haven't yet identified or resolved. For example, many first-generation products, from gaming consoles to smartphones, have had significant problems that were fixed in later versions. By waiting several months, I can benefit from software updates, hardware revisions, and the manufacturer's learning curve. Secondly, prices typically drop significantly after the initial release period. Electronics companies often price new products at premium levels to maximize profits from eager early adopters, but competition and economies of scale usually drive prices down within six months to a year. Additionally, waiting allows me to read comprehensive reviews from multiple sources and real users, giving me a much clearer picture of whether the product truly meets my needs and expectations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

For example, if a manager is close friends with an employee, they might find it difficult to give honest performance feedback, assign challenging tasks fairly, or make objective decisions about promotions and salary increases. This can lead to favoritism, which creates resentment among other team members and damages overall workplace morale.

The most significant advantage is the time savings and convenience factor.

Use examples to explain your view.\n\nStudent Response: I strongly agree that children should learn how to draw and paint at school. Firstly, it's crucial for developing creativity and self-expression. Art allows children to communicate ideas and emotions in ways that words cannot always capture. This creative outlet is particularly important for children who may struggle with traditional academic subjects or verbal communication. For example, a shy child might find it easier to express their feelings through a painting rather than speaking in class. This form of expression can boost confidence and provide valuable emotional release. Secondly, art education enhances cognitive development and improves skills that benefit other academic areas. Drawing and painting require careful observation, spatial reasoning, and fine motor coordination. These skills transfer to subjects like mathematics, science, and writing. Research has shown that students who participate in art programs often perform better in standardized tests and demonstrate improved problem-solving abilities across all subjects."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The primary reason is that many students, especially those coming directly from high school, lack sufficient exposure to different academic fields to make an informed decision about their life's direction. During the first two years of university, students can take general education courses across various disciplines and discover subjects they never knew existed or interests they didn't realize they had. For example, a student who thinks they want to study business might discover a passion for psychology or environmental science after taking introductory courses in these fields. Additionally, delaying major selection allows students to mature emotionally and intellectually before committing to a specific career path. The transition from high school to university involves significant personal growth, and students often develop clearer self-awareness about their strengths, values, and career goals after experiencing university-level coursework and campus life. This leads to more thoughtful, confident decisions about their academic focus."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

They do this because they think it will make them appear more attractive to others. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your answer with details and examples.\n\nStudent Response: I think it's a really fantastic idea to get surgery to change your appearance.  I feel this way for two reasons. First of all, it can make us feel a lot more confident about ourselves.  When we look in the mirror and we're happy with what we see, it's much easier for us to feel good about ourselves in general.  This can help us in other areas of our lives, like in our careers or in our relationships.  Secondly, I think that these days, plastic surgery is much safer than it used to be.  Doctors have much better training, and the procedures are much more predictable and successful.  So I think that the risks are much lower than they used to be, and the benefits are much greater."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The government should forbid violence and bad language on television. Use details and examples in your response.\n\nStudent Response: I agree that the government should regulate, though perhaps not completely forbid, violence and bad language on television. The most compelling reason is the protection of children who are still developing their understanding of appropriate behavior and social norms. Research consistently shows that young viewers can be significantly influenced by media content, and excessive exposure to violence or inappropriate language can normalize these behaviors. For example, studies have found correlations between violent media consumption and increased aggressive behavior in children. However, I believe the solution should involve thoughtful regulation rather than complete censorship - such as mandatory content warnings, restricted broadcasting hours for explicit content, and robust parental control systems. This approach balances protecting vulnerable viewers while preserving freedom of expression and allowing adults to make informed choices about their entertainment. Complete prohibition would be too restrictive, but reasonable regulation helps create a media environment that serves both artistic freedom and social responsibility."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The first major benefit is the increased flexibility and work-life balance. Working from home allows you to manage personal appointments or family needs more easily. For example, you can be home when your children get back from school. The second reason is the elimination of the daily commute.

What makes this dish so special to me is not just its incredible flavor - with the perfect balance of spicy, sour, and savory tastes - but also the memories associated with it. My grandmother used to make this for our family every Sunday, and the aroma would fill the entire house. It's comfort food that represents home to me. The aged kimchi gives it a deep, complex flavor that you simply can't replicate with fresh kimchi. Second, Bibimbap, which literally means \"\"mixed rice,\"\" is a colorful bowl containing rice topped with seasoned vegetables, meat, a fried egg, and gochujang (Korean chili paste).

Firstly, jeong represents a unique form of emotional connection and loyalty that goes beyond simple friendship or family bonds. It's a deep affection and attachment that Koreans develop for people, places, and even objects over time. This cultural value emphasizes the importance of maintaining long-term relationships and showing care for others, even when it might be inconvenient. You can see jeong in how Koreans will go out of their way to help someone they've developed this bond with, whether it's a neighbor, coworker, or even a favorite restaurant owner. Secondly, jeong influences how we approach community and social responsibility. It creates a sense of collective care where people look out for each other's wellbeing, share resources during difficult times, and celebrate successes together. This cultural foundation helps explain why Korean society tends to be very interconnected and why relationships are so central to both personal and professional life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Explain your opinion.\n\nStudent Response: I believe it is better to follow your passion. Firstly, genuine passion is a powerful motivator for long-term success and personal fulfillment. When you truly love what you do, you're more likely to excel at it because you'll willingly invest the extra time and effort needed to master your craft. This dedication often leads to better performance and, ultimately, greater financial rewards than simply choosing a stable but uninspiring job. For instance, many successful entrepreneurs started by pursuing their passions despite initial financial uncertainty, and their enthusiasm helped them overcome obstacles that would have defeated someone who was just working for a paycheck.

Since we spend a huge portion of our lives working, doing something you're passionate about makes those hours feel fulfilling rather than like a burden. When you love your job, you're more likely to excel at it, which can eventually lead to better compensation and career advancement anyway. Secondly, job satisfaction affects your overall quality of life. A high-paying job that you hate can lead to stress, burnout, and unhappiness that spills over into your personal life. In contrast, when you're excited about your work, you bring that positive energy home with you, which benefits your relationships and overall well-being.

While online learning offers certain conveniences, I believe traditional classroom education provides superior learning outcomes for most students. Firstly, in-person education offers immediate interaction and feedback that online learning cannot match. In a physical classroom, students can ask questions spontaneously, engage in group discussions, and receive instant clarification from instructors. This dynamic interaction helps students understand complex concepts more quickly and thoroughly. For example, in my chemistry classes, being able to observe experiments in real-time and ask questions immediately led to much better comprehension than watching pre-recorded videos would have. Secondly, traditional education provides essential social skills development. Students learn to collaborate, present ideas confidently, and navigate interpersonal relationships—skills that are crucial for professional success but difficult to develop through a screen."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The first reason is that food is a universal language that brings people together from different cultures. At a food fair, I can taste authentic dishes from various countries and learn about their cultural significance. For instance, I remember attending a similar event where I tried Ethiopian injera bread and learned about the traditional coffee ceremony, which gave me insight into their social customs. The second reason is that food fairs are inherently interactive and social. Unlike concerts or dance performances where you're mostly observing, at a food fair you can engage directly with people from different backgrounds, ask questions about their cuisine, and even learn cooking techniques. This creates meaningful cross-cultural connections that extend beyond just the event itself."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

While technical subjects are certainly valuable, I believe all areas of study contribute essential skills for a well-rounded education. Firstly, literature and the arts develop critical thinking and emotional intelligence in ways that math and science cannot. When students analyze poetry or interpret a painting, they learn to consider multiple perspectives and understand complex human emotions. These skills are crucial for effective communication and leadership in any field. For example, many successful business leaders credit their liberal arts education with helping them understand and motivate diverse teams. Secondly, creativity and artistic expression are fundamental to human culture and innovation. Even in technical fields, creative thinking often leads to breakthrough discoveries.

The only real way for kids to absorb a lesson is to actually go home and repeat it as much as they possibly can.  And in the long run this kind of thing will lead to a lot more academic success.

A full bus or train takes many cars off the road, which significantly reduces air pollution and traffic congestion in the city. I feel good knowing I'm making a more sustainable choice. The second reason is that it's more relaxing for me. When I drive, I have to deal with the stress of traffic, looking for parking, and the cost of gas and maintenance.

The event exceeded all our expectations, raising over $5,000 for local conservation efforts and attracting more than 200 attendees.

The primary reason is the more intimate and personal atmosphere that small events provide. At a local community festival or small concert, you can actually interact with the performers, meet the organizers, and have meaningful conversations with other attendees. Large international festivals, while exciting, can be overwhelming and impersonal due to massive crowds. Additionally, local events often showcase the unique culture and traditions of the community, giving me a more authentic and educational experience. For example, a small local harvest festival teaches me about regional agriculture and customs in a way that a huge commercial festival simply cannot. The sense of community and connection I feel at smaller events is much more valuable to me than the spectacle of large festivals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Government regulations create a level playing field where all companies must comply with environmental standards, preventing businesses from gaining unfair competitive advantages by cutting environmental corners.

Secondly, it's a holiday that perfectly balances tradition with joy and celebration.

The primary reason is the more intimate and personal atmosphere that small events provide. At a local community festival or small concert, you can actually interact with the performers, meet the organizers, and have meaningful conversations with other attendees. Large international festivals, while exciting, can be overwhelming and impersonal due to massive crowds. Additionally, local events often showcase the unique culture and traditions of the community, giving me a more authentic and educational experience. For example, a small local harvest festival teaches me about regional agriculture and customs in a way that a huge commercial festival simply cannot. The sense of community and connection I feel at smaller events is much more valuable to me than the spectacle of large festivals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Each season offers unique activities and beauty - skiing in winter, hiking in spring, swimming in summer, and enjoying colorful foliage in fall. This constant change prevents life from becoming monotonous and gives me something to look forward to. Second, seasonal changes help me appreciate each period more fully.

Explain your opinion.\n\nStudent Response: Yes, I believe reading books is still very important in the digital age. Firstly, reading books, particularly physical books, promotes deep concentration and sustained attention in ways that digital media often doesn't. The linear, immersive nature of book reading helps develop focus and critical thinking skills that are increasingly valuable in our distraction-filled world. Secondly, books offer depth and nuance that shorter digital content typically lacks. Authors have space to develop complex arguments, create detailed worlds, and explore ideas thoroughly. This depth is crucial for developing sophisticated understanding of topics. Finally, reading has been shown to have cognitive benefits including improved vocabulary, empathy, and analytical thinking. While digital resources are valuable for quick information access, I believe books remain essential for developing intellectual depth and maintaining cognitive health."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Which do you prefer and why?\n\nStudent Response: I definitely prefer to plan my free time in advance. The first reason is that it helps me make the most of my time off. If I don't have a plan, I often end up wasting the day just trying to decide what to do, or I might default to less productive activities like scrolling through social media or watching TV. When I plan ahead, I can ensure that I engage in activities that I truly enjoy and that contribute to my personal growth. For example, I might schedule time for exercise, meeting friends, pursuing hobbies, or exploring new places in my city. Additionally, planning helps me balance different aspects of my life. I can make sure to allocate time for both social activities and personal reflection, or balance fun activities with necessary tasks like shopping or cleaning. However, I do try to maintain some flexibility in my plans. I might leave some time slots open for spontaneous activities or unexpected opportunities. This way, I get the benefits of planning while still being able to adapt to circumstances as they arise."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Children born with talents should be treated in a different way, or they should be treated in the same way as average children?\n\nStudent Response: I believe children born with exceptional talents should be treated differently, but only in terms of their education and training. On one hand, it's crucial to nurture and develop their special abilities through advanced programs, specialized coaching, or accelerated learning opportunities. Gifted children often become bored or frustrated in regular classrooms because the pace is too slow for them. However, when it comes to values like respect, kindness, and responsibility, they should be treated exactly the same as other children. They should learn that talent doesn't make them superior as human beings, and they still need to work hard and treat others with respect to succeed in life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Others think that friends are the most important influence. Which view do you agree with and why?\n\nStudent Response: I believe that family is the most important influence on young adults. First, family provides the foundational values and moral framework that guide young people throughout their lives. Parents and family members have been shaping a person's character since birth, establishing core beliefs about right and wrong, work ethic, and life priorities. These deep-rooted influences typically persist even when friends come and go. Second, family members genuinely care about a young adult's long-term wellbeing and success, while friends may not always have their best interests at heart. Parents and siblings want to see their family member succeed and will often give honest, sometimes difficult advice because they love them unconditionally. Friends, especially during young adulthood, may be more focused on immediate fun and may encourage risky or irresponsible behavior."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

This is much more relaxing than rushing around. Second, I would strongly suggest they learn a few basic Korean phrases like \"\"hello\"\" (annyeonghaseyo) and \"\"thank you\"\" (kamsahamnida).

Firstly, jeong represents a deep, emotional connection and sense of affection that Koreans feel toward one another, extending beyond just family members to friends, neighbors, and even strangers. This cultural value emphasizes empathy, loyalty, and mutual care. For example, it's common for neighbors to share food with each other, especially during holidays, or for colleagues to go out of their way to help each other both professionally and personally. This creates a sense of community that I find very warm and supportive. Secondly, jeong manifests in our approach to relationships, which tend to be long-term and deeply committed. Unlike more individualistic cultures, Koreans often prioritize group harmony and collective well-being over personal convenience. This can be seen in how we maintain friendships from childhood well into adulthood, and how families remain closely connected across generations, with adult children often caring for elderly parents."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

First of all, young teachers can relate more to their students.  They simply have a lot more in common with them in terms of personal interests and pop culture awareness.  As a result, it's easier for them to connect the classroom material to the real lives of the students.  This can encourage kids to stay motivated and keep on task for their whole school day.

The primary reason is their unprecedented connectivity and accessibility. Smart phones allow students to access educational resources, communicate with professors and classmates, and manage their academic schedules from anywhere at any time. For instance, I can quickly look up unfamiliar terms during lectures, participate in study groups through messaging apps, and receive immediate notifications about assignment deadlines. This constant connectivity has revolutionized how students engage with their education. Additionally, smart phones have transformed the learning process itself by enabling multimedia learning experiences.

The world is quiet, there are fewer distractions, and I can focus on my most important tasks without interruption. This allows me to accomplish more meaningful work before most people are even awake. Second, waking up early gives me more time to enjoy the day. I can have a leisurely breakfast, exercise, read the news, or pursue hobbies before starting my work day.

When I read, I create the characters and the world in my own mind, which makes the experience more personal and engaging. For instance, when I read fantasy novels, I can imagine the magical worlds exactly as I want them to be, whereas movies impose the director's vision on me. Additionally, books provide more detailed character development and plot complexity. Authors have unlimited space to develop their characters' thoughts, motivations, and backgrounds, creating more nuanced and realistic personalities. Movies, constrained by time, often have to simplify characters and rush through important plot points, which can make the story feel less satisfying and complete."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

This concept influences how Koreans interact with each other, creating strong community ties and lasting relationships. Secondly, jeong manifests in everyday life through acts of generosity and consideration.

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, and it's the foundation of all healthy relationships. Children who learn empathy become more compassionate friends, partners, and community members. They are better able to resolve conflicts peacefully and are less likely to engage in bullying behavior. Secondly, empathy helps children develop emotional intelligence, which is just as important as academic intelligence for success in life. It helps them understand their own emotions as well as those of others."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The main reason is that our family shapes our fundamental values, beliefs, and personality during our most formative years. From birth through adolescence, we spend most of our time with family members who teach us basic social skills, moral principles, and ways of viewing the world. These early influences are so deep that they often persist throughout our entire lives. For example, my parents taught me the importance of honesty and hard work when I was very young, and these values still guide my decisions today.

While a higher salary is always important, perks can often provide more long-term value and job satisfaction. Firstly, certain benefits like health insurance, retirement contributions, and professional development opportunities can be worth more to employees than their cash equivalent. For example, employer-provided health insurance often costs the company less than what an individual would pay privately, making it a win-win situation. Professional development programs and educational reimbursements help employees grow in their careers, which benefits both the individual and the company in the long run. Secondly, thoughtful perks can significantly improve work-life balance and company culture. Benefits like flexible working hours, remote work options, generous vacation time, and wellness programs can reduce stress and increase productivity. These perks often cost companies relatively little compared to salary increases but can have a huge impact on employee satisfaction and retention. When employees feel cared for and valued beyond just their paycheck, they are more likely to be loyal and motivated."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Support your opinion with specific reasons.\n\nStudent Response: I agree that children should receive money for doing chores. Firstly, it's an excellent way to teach them the value of work and money from a young age. When children understand that money is earned through effort, they develop a better appreciation for both work and money. They learn that nothing in life is free and that financial rewards come from contributing value. Secondly, paying children for chores motivates them to take on more responsibilities around the house. When there's a direct connection between their work and their reward, children are more likely to complete tasks without being asked multiple times. This also helps them develop good work habits that will benefit them throughout their lives. For example, I received money for chores as a child, and it taught me to be responsible and financially aware."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Firstly, education provides essential knowledge, critical thinking skills, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's knowledge-based economy, these skills are crucial for most career paths and for making informed decisions in personal life. Education also opens doors to opportunities that might otherwise be unavailable. Secondly, education teaches discipline, perseverance, and the ability to learn continuously - traits that are valuable regardless of your specific field. However, I think other factors are also crucial for success. Personal characteristics like determination, creativity, emotional intelligence, and the ability to work with others are equally important. Additionally, factors like access to opportunities, networks, and sometimes luck also play significant roles. I believe the most successful people combine good education with strong personal qualities and the ability to build meaningful relationships."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Additionally, maintaining quality friendships requires significant time and emotional investment.

Firstly, it teaches them responsibility and a strong work ethic. Having to show up on time, follow a manager's instructions, and provide good customer service are invaluable life lessons. Secondly, it's an excellent introduction to financial literacy. Earning their own money will teach them how to budget, save, and understand the value of a dollar.

Gaining experience in the workplace while still in high school can help them determine what they want to do for the rest of their lives."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

I had always been a good student in high school and had never experienced failure like this before, so it was quite a shock. Initially, I felt very discouraged and began to doubt my abilities. However, this experience taught me important lessons about resilience and study strategies. First, I realized that university-level coursework required different approaches than high school. I needed to be more proactive about seeking help and couldn't rely solely on what I learned in class. So I started attending office hours regularly and forming study groups with classmates. Second, I learned the importance of consistent daily practice rather than cramming before exams. I developed better time management skills and dedicated specific hours each day to mathematics. By the end of the semester, I had improved significantly and ultimately passed the course with a B+."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Also, letting children make this choice teaches them to think about their interests and be responsible for their decisions, which is important for growing up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 3\n\nThis response appropriately addresses the task with generally clear speech and some fluency.

University life can be extremely stressful, with students facing academic pressure, financial concerns, and the challenge of adapting to a new environment. Entertainment events provide essential stress relief and help prevent burnout, which can actually improve academic performance in the long run. For example, students who attend campus concerts or movie nights often report feeling more relaxed and better able to focus on their studies afterward. Secondly, entertainment events foster community building and social connections among students. Universities aren't just about academics; they're also about creating well-rounded individuals with strong social skills. Campus entertainment brings together students from different backgrounds, majors, and social groups, helping them form friendships and networks that often last a lifetime. These social connections are crucial for student retention and contribute to a positive campus culture."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Since we spend so much time at work, enjoying what you do is essential for overall well-being. Secondly, passion and interest in your field often lead to better performance, which can eventually result in financial success anyway. When you're genuinely engaged in your work, you're more likely to excel and advance. Finally, non-monetary factors like work-life balance, meaningful contribution to society, and opportunities for growth and learning can provide satisfaction that money alone cannot.

Firstly, physical activities help me feel more energized and refreshed for the upcoming week. After sitting at a desk all week for work or study, my body craves movement and fresh air. For example, I love going hiking on Saturday mornings - the exercise and nature help clear my mind and boost my mood significantly. Secondly, active weekends allow me to pursue hobbies and try new experiences. Whether it's playing tennis with friends, taking a photography walk around the city, or trying a new fitness class, these activities make my weekends feel fulfilling and help me grow as a person.

First of all, I think that it will help children to retain what they learn for a much longer period of time.  The only real way for kids to absorb a lesson is to actually go home and repeat it as much as they possibly can.  And in the long run this kind of thing will lead to a lot more academic success. Secondly, I believe that homework can actually give children an opportunity to bond with their parents.  For example, I got a lot of daily homework when I was in elementary school. And I'd go home and do it with my mom and dad, and I'd ask them questions whenever I was having trouble.

Our world is increasingly interconnected through business, travel, and digital communication. Being bilingual opens up career opportunities in multinational companies and allows people to work internationally. For example, my cousin learned Mandarin and now works for a tech company with offices in both the US and China. The second reason is cultural understanding.

The palace grounds are expansive, offering numerous photo opportunities and peaceful spaces for reflection.

Many visitors rent traditional Korean clothing called hanbok to wear while exploring the palace, which creates a unique connection to Korean culture and history.

First, he was incredibly passionate about his subject matter, and this enthusiasm was genuinely contagious. When he talked about historical events, he would use dramatic storytelling techniques that made ancient civilizations and historical figures come alive in our minds. He didn't just teach dates and facts; he helped us understand the human emotions and motivations behind historical events.

Firstly, learning a foreign language has significant cognitive benefits that extend far beyond just communication skills. Research consistently shows that bilingual individuals demonstrate enhanced problem-solving abilities, improved memory, and greater mental flexibility. These cognitive advantages can improve academic performance across all subjects, not just language arts. For example, students who study foreign languages often score higher on standardized tests in mathematics and reading comprehension. Secondly, in our increasingly globalized world, foreign language skills are becoming essential for career advancement and cultural understanding. Many professions now require or strongly prefer candidates who can communicate in multiple languages. Additionally, learning a foreign language helps students develop empathy and cultural awareness by exposing them to different ways of thinking and living. This cultural competency is invaluable in our diverse society and helps create more informed, tolerant citizens."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

First of all, too much time spent watching the nightly news might make me feel kind of pessimistic about the world.

For complex subjects like organic chemistry or advanced mathematics, I need complete mental focus to understand intricate concepts and solve problems systematically. For example, when studying for my calculus final in a silent library study room, I could work through challenging equations without interruption, resulting in much better comprehension than when I attempted the same material in a noisy coffee shop.

Students should be involved in decisions about how universities set their budgets.\n\nStudent Response: Personally, I don't think students should make decisions about how universities set their budgets.  First of all, students only attend universities for a short period of time.  As a result, they might decide to spend money on programs that provide immediate benefits, instead of on programs that are advantageous over the long run.  For instance, students might want to spend a ton of money on sports teams instead of constructing buildings that can be used for many decades. Secondly, students don't have much training in terms of academic administration and management.  Accordingly, they might make decisions that aren't in the best interest of their school.  For instance, they might accidentally overpay when hiring professors or signing contracts with suppliers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The main reason is that shared experiences create stronger emotional connections and lasting memories. When you attend an event with friends, you can discuss your reactions in real-time, share exciting moments, and create inside jokes that you'll remember for years to come. For instance, when I went to see my favorite band with my best friend, we spent the entire evening talking about our favorite songs and comparing our reactions to different performances. This made the experience much more meaningful than if I had gone alone. Additionally, friends can enhance the overall experience by providing different perspectives and insights. They might notice details you missed or interpret artistic elements in ways that deepen your understanding and appreciation. The social aspect also reduces any potential anxiety or awkwardness, particularly in crowded venues, making the entire experience more comfortable and enjoyable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Methods like lectures and textbook-based learning can effectively transmit foundational knowledge and have proven successful for generations. They provide structure and ensure comprehensive coverage of important material. However, today's students have grown up with interactive technology and often learn better through hands-on, collaborative, and multimedia approaches. Modern students also need to develop different skills like digital literacy, critical evaluation of online information, and adaptability to rapid change. The most effective approach combines the best of both worlds - using traditional methods for building solid foundations while incorporating modern techniques like project-based learning, technology integration, and collaborative problem-solving. Teachers should also recognize that students today have access to vast amounts of information, so the focus should shift from just delivering content to teaching how to analyze, synthesize, and apply knowledge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

First, cities offer significantly more educational and cultural opportunities. Children in cities have access to world-class museums, libraries, theaters, and diverse educational programs that simply aren't available in small towns. For example, a child in New York can visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attend specialized schools for the arts or sciences, and experience cultural diversity that broadens their worldview. Second, growing up in a city better prepares children for the globalized, interconnected world they'll live in as adults. They learn to navigate complex social situations, adapt to diversity, and develop the skills needed to succeed in competitive, fast-paced environments.\n\nStudent Response: I think both options have advantages, but I prefer one choice because it is more practical for me.

Firstly, practical skills like financial literacy, basic cooking, and home maintenance are essential for independent adult life, yet many students graduate without these abilities. I've seen college students struggle with basic tasks like budgeting or preparing healthy meals because they never learned these skills in school. Secondly, practical skills often provide immediate real-world application that can make learning more engaging and relevant for students. However, academic subjects like mathematics, science, and literature are crucial for developing critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and cultural literacy. The ideal approach would be integrating practical applications into academic subjects rather than completely replacing them.

Use examples to support your answer.\n\nStudent Response: I disagree that a university's academic reputation should be the top factor. While it's important, I think the specific program and campus environment are more crucial considerations. Firstly, the quality of the specific program you're interested in matters more than the overall university reputation. A university might have a great general reputation but a weak program in your field of study. For example, a friend of mine chose a lesser-known university because it had an exceptional engineering program with state-of-the-art facilities and industry connections, and she got a better education than she would have at a more prestigious school. Secondly, the campus culture and whether you feel comfortable there significantly impacts your learning experience.

When I learned that in some cultures, direct eye contact can be considered disrespectful, it helped me adjust my behavior when interacting with people from those backgrounds. Additionally, understanding other cultures broadens our perspective and helps us appreciate the diversity of human experiences. This knowledge is particularly valuable in today's interconnected world where we frequently work and interact with people from various cultural backgrounds, whether in business, education, or social settings.

Second, Bibimbap is this beautiful, colorful dish that combines rice with various seasoned vegetables, meat, and a fried egg on top. I love how each ingredient maintains its distinct flavor while creating harmony when mixed together with gochujang sauce. It's both healthy and delicious, representing the Korean philosophy of balanced eating."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.
