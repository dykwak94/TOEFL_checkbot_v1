I love it for two main reasons. First, it has an incredibly clever and unpredictable plot that keeps you engaged from beginning to end. The way director Bong Joon-ho weaves together elements of dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary is masterful. Just when you think you understand where the story is going, it takes another surprising turn. The cinematography and symbolism are also remarkable â€“ every visual element serves a purpose in telling the story. Second, it provides a profound commentary on social inequality that resonates not just in Korea but worldwide. The film explores class differences in a way that's both entertaining and thought-provoking, making you reflect on social issues long after the movie ends."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

One person might excel at analytical thinking while another brings creative solutions, and together they can approach problems from multiple angles. For example, in my computer science class, our group project succeeded because one member was great at coding, another at design, and I contributed research skills. None of us could have created such a comprehensive solution alone. Secondly, teamwork allows for error-checking and quality improvement. When multiple people review ideas and solutions, they can catch mistakes and suggest improvements that an individual might miss. However, effective teamwork requires good communication and leadership to coordinate efforts and resolve conflicts when they arise."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

During Seollal, multiple generations of our family gather together to perform ancestral rituals, share traditional foods like tteokguk and jeon, and exchange stories about our family history. These traditions connect me to my cultural roots and create a strong sense of belonging and identity. Secondly, it represents new beginnings and hope for the future.

Secondly, experiences contribute to personal growth and learning in ways that material possessions simply cannot.

Firstly, environmental problems are caused by the collective actions of billions of people, so the solution must also involve individual behavioral changes. Simple actions like reducing energy consumption, using public transportation, recycling, and choosing sustainable products can have a significant cumulative impact when adopted by many people. Secondly, individual responsibility creates awareness and education that can lead to broader societal changes. When people make environmentally conscious choices in their daily lives, they become more informed about environmental issues and are more likely to support environmental policies and vote for leaders who prioritize sustainability. Finally, taking personal responsibility gives individuals a sense of agency and empowerment rather than feeling helpless about global problems.

Firstly, it keeps me motivated and mentally engaged throughout the entire workday. When there are multiple deadlines, urgent projects, and constant challenges, I feel energized and focused rather than bored or sluggish. For example, when I worked as a server in a busy restaurant during peak hours, the constant flow of orders and customer requests kept me alert and efficient. I thrived on the adrenaline and sense of accomplishment that came from handling multiple tasks simultaneously. Secondly, fast-paced environments typically offer more opportunities for rapid skill development and career advancement. The pressure to perform quickly and efficiently forces me to learn new techniques, improve my problem-solving abilities, and become more versatile. This accelerated growth is much more appealing to me than the stagnation that can occur in slower work environments."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

I see my bookshelf as a record of my intellectual journey and personal interests, and I enjoy being surrounded by books that have influenced my thinking. Additionally, when I own a book, I can write notes in the margins, highlight important passages, and refer back to specific sections whenever I want. For example, I often revisit certain chapters in my favorite non-fiction books when I need inspiration or want to refresh my memory on key concepts. Finally, having my own books means I can lend them to friends and family, which allows me to share knowledge and start meaningful conversations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

I love activities like swimming, hiking, and playing sports, which are much more enjoyable and accessible when the weather is consistently pleasant. For instance, in a warm climate, I can go for a morning run on the beach or have a barbecue with friends in January, while in a cold climate, I'd be stuck indoors for months.

Structure provides multiple psychological and practical benefits that enhance productivity and well-being. First, routines eliminate decision fatigue by establishing automatic patterns for daily activities, allowing mental energy to focus on important tasks rather than mundane choices. For example, having set times for exercise, meals, and work creates consistency that improves both physical health and professional performance. Additionally, structured routines help establish healthy habits and provide stability during stressful periods.

I learned to communicate across cultural barriers and developed a much more nuanced understanding of global issues. Secondly, this experience built my confidence and independence in ways I never expected.

Close friends really know you - your values, struggles, and dreams - and can offer meaningful advice and comfort during difficult times. This depth of connection is more valuable than surface-level interactions with many people. Secondly, maintaining close friendships requires and develops important life skills like trust, loyalty, empathy, and communication. These relationships teach you how to resolve conflicts, be vulnerable, and support others through challenges.

Regular physical activity reduces the risk of serious diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It also helps maintain a healthy weight and improves immune system function. Secondly, exercise has significant mental health benefits. Physical activity releases endorphins that improve mood and reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It can also improve sleep quality and cognitive function. Finally, exercise contributes to longevity and quality of life.

This scientifically-backed approach optimizes my study time by focusing on what I need to review most. The algorithm tracks my performance and adjusts the frequency of each card accordingly, ensuring I don't waste time on material I've already mastered.

Without deadlines, I tend to procrastinate on less enjoyable tasks and focus on whatever seems most interesting at the moment, which can lead to important work being left unfinished. For example, when I have a paper due in two weeks, I plan my research and writing schedule backward from that date, which ensures steady progress.

The reason is that, whether they choose this responsibility or not, celebrities have enormous influence on young people's behavior, values, and aspirations. Social media has made this influence even more direct and personal than in the past. When young people see their favorite actors, musicians, or athletes engaging in positive behaviors like charitable work, education advocacy, or healthy lifestyle choices, it can inspire them to make similar positive choices in their own lives. For example, when celebrities like Malala Yousafzai use their platform to promote education, or when athletes speak out against bullying, they can reach and influence millions of young people in ways that parents and teachers alone cannot. While celebrities are human and will make mistakes, those who consciously try to model positive behavior can contribute significantly to youth development and social progress.

A job that provides purpose and personal fulfillment creates lasting satisfaction that money alone cannot provide. Second, excessive focus on salary can lead to jobs that are stressful, demanding, or ethically questionable, ultimately causing burnout and unhappiness.

For instance, understanding that direct eye contact is considered disrespectful in some Asian cultures prevents unintentional offense in international business settings. Additionally, cultural learning broadens perspectives and challenges assumptions about 'normal' behavior.

Support your response with reasons.\n\nStudent Response: I disagree with the idea that fewer people will read books in the future. While the format may change, I believe reading will continue to thrive for several important reasons. Firstly, reading provides unique cognitive benefits that cannot be replicated by other forms of media. Books require sustained attention and deep thinking, which helps develop critical analysis skills, vocabulary, and imagination in ways that watching videos or scrolling through social media cannot match. As people become more aware of the negative effects of constant digital stimulation, many are deliberately seeking out the focused, immersive experience that books provide. For example, the growing popularity of digital detox movements suggests that people are recognizing the value of slower, more contemplative activities like reading. Secondly, books offer unparalleled depth and complexity of ideas. While other media forms excel at providing quick information or entertainment, books remain the best medium for exploring complex topics, developing nuanced arguments, and telling sophisticated stories. As society faces increasingly complex challenges, the need for this kind of deep, analytical thinking will only grow."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Secondly, projects help to develop a wider range of important skills, such as research, creativity, problem-solving, and time management. These are practical skills that are highly valuable in the real world, whereas test-taking is a much more limited skill."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Firstly, learning to play an instrument develops discipline and perseverance. Music requires regular practice and patience to see improvement, which teaches children valuable life skills about working toward long-term goals. For example, when I learned piano as a child, I had to practice scales and pieces repeatedly, which taught me that success comes from consistent effort over time. This discipline carried over into my academic work and other activities. Secondly, music education enhances cognitive development and academic performance. Research has consistently shown that children who study music perform better in mathematics, reading, and other subjects. Music involves pattern recognition, memory, and complex thinking skills that benefit overall brain development. Additionally, music provides an emotional outlet and a way for children to express themselves creatively, which is important for psychological well-being and personal development."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Explain why.\n\nStudent Response: I would choose to live in a big city over a small town. The primary reason is the diversity of experiences available. Big cities are melting pots of different cultures, which means I can try authentic food from all over the world, attend cultural festivals, and meet people from different backgrounds. This is incredibly enriching. Furthermore, big cities offer better public transportation. I prefer not to own a car, so having access to an efficient subway or bus system makes it easy to get around and explore different neighborhoods without worrying about traffic or parking."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

You can compare prices across multiple retailers instantly and access products that might not be available in local stores.

My first reason is that it has contributed to a more sedentary lifestyle. Many people spend hours each day watching television instead of engaging in physical activities or pursuing more intellectually stimulating hobbies. This has contributed to rising obesity rates and declining physical fitness across many populations. For example, children who watch several hours of television daily are much less likely to participate in sports or outdoor activities. My second reason is that television often promotes unrealistic expectations and values. Many programs emphasize materialism, violence, or superficial beauty standards that can negatively influence viewers, especially young people. Reality shows, for instance, often glorify conflict and drama rather than promoting positive social values or meaningful relationships."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The primary reason is the variety and richness that seasonal changes bring to life. Each season offers unique experiences and activities - skiing and cozy fireplaces in winter, fresh blooms and mild temperatures in spring, outdoor festivals and swimming in summer, and beautiful foliage and harvest celebrations in fall. This constant change keeps life interesting and gives me something to look forward to throughout the year. Additionally, I find that seasonal changes create a natural rhythm and help mark the passage of time in a meaningful way. The transition from one season to another feels like turning pages in a book, with each chapter offering its own character and mood.

The primary reason is that business fundamentally relies on relationships and trust. No matter how knowledgeable someone is, if they cannot communicate effectively, build rapport with clients, or collaborate with team members, their expertise becomes less valuable. Outgoing and friendly people excel at networking, which often leads to new opportunities, partnerships, and business deals that knowledge alone cannot secure. For instance, I've observed that salespeople who are genuinely personable often outperform those who simply know the most about their products. However, I would emphasize that this doesn't mean knowledge is unimportant - rather, the combination of both interpersonal skills and expertise creates the most powerful foundation for business success.

The main reason is that smartphones are incredibly distracting and prevent students from developing deep focus and attention skills. Even when students think they're multitasking effectively, research shows that constantly switching between their phone and classwork significantly reduces learning and comprehension. I've observed that students with phones spend class time checking social media, texting, or playing games instead of engaging with the lesson. Additionally, smartphones can create social problems in the classroom, such as cyberbullying or social pressure related to social media posts. However, I do see value in using smartphones for specific educational purposes, like research projects or educational apps, when the teacher controls and directs their use. The key is having clear policies that maximize learning while minimizing distraction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

First, cities offer significantly more educational and cultural opportunities. Children in cities have access to world-class museums, libraries, theaters, and diverse educational programs that simply aren't available in small towns. For example, a child in New York can visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attend specialized schools for the arts or sciences, and experience cultural diversity that broadens their worldview.

They learn to navigate complex social situations, adapt to diversity, and develop the skills needed to succeed in competitive, fast-paced environments."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Use specific details and examples to support your answer.\n\nStudent Response: I disagree with the statement that university students should have separate residence halls. Firstly, coeducational living arrangements better prepare students for real-world social and professional interactions. In most workplaces and adult living situations, people interact daily with individuals of all genders, so learning to navigate these relationships respectfully and professionally during university years is invaluable preparation for life after graduation. For example, students who live in mixed-gender dorms often develop better communication skills and mutual respect that serves them well in their careers. Secondly, separate residence halls can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and limit opportunities for meaningful friendships and collaboration. When students live in integrated environments, they naturally form study groups, participate in activities together, and develop platonic relationships that enrich their university experience. Some of my closest friendships and most successful academic partnerships have been with people of different genders, relationships that might never have formed in a segregated housing system."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

When people can instantly Google any question or binge-watch endless content, they spend less time in the kind of mental spaces where creativity flourishes - like boredom, contemplation, or problem-solving without external help. Additionally, social media algorithms tend to show us similar content, creating echo chambers that limit exposure to diverse ideas and perspectives that spark creativity. However, I acknowledge that technology also provides powerful creative tools like digital art software, music production programs, and platforms for sharing creative work.

My mind feels fresh and clear after a good night's sleep, and I can concentrate much better on important tasks. For example, I do my best writing and studying between 6 and 9 AM, when there are fewer distractions and my energy levels are highest. Secondly, waking up early allows me to establish a peaceful morning routine that sets a positive tone for the entire day. I can enjoy a quiet cup of coffee, do some light exercise, or read for pleasure before the rush of daily responsibilities begins. This calm start helps me feel more centered and prepared to handle whatever challenges the day might bring. In contrast, staying up late often leaves me feeling groggy and less efficient the next day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Additionally, participating in sports builds character through teamwork, discipline, and goal-setting.

I can slow down for particularly beautiful or complex passages that I want to savor, or speed up during action sequences when I'm eager to see what happens next. With audiobooks, I'm stuck with the narrator's pace, which might not match my preferences. Secondly, I find it much easier to remember details when I read. I can flip back through the pages to check character names, plot points, or previous events, which helps me keep track of complex storylines.

Downtown areas are already overcrowded, and limiting private vehicles would significantly improve air quality and make these areas more livable. Cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have successfully implemented such policies with great results. The second reason is that banning cars would encourage the use of public transportation, walking, and cycling, which are more sustainable and healthier alternatives.

While higher salaries are important for meeting basic needs and financial security, additional benefits can significantly improve quality of life and job satisfaction in ways that money alone cannot. For example, flexible working arrangements allow employees to achieve better work-life balance, which reduces stress and increases productivity. Health insurance, paid vacation time, and professional development opportunities show that the company values employees as whole people, not just workers. These benefits often cost the company less than equivalent salary increases but provide tremendous value to employees. Furthermore, certain perks like gym memberships, on-site childcare, or continuing education support can help employees improve their personal lives and career prospects, creating loyalty and reducing turnover costs for the company."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

The primary reason independence is crucial is that it builds self-confidence and resilience. When you can solve your own problems and make your own decisions, you develop a strong sense of self-efficacy that serves you throughout life. You don't have to wait for others or depend on their availability when challenges arise. However, I also believe that knowing when and how to seek help is equally important.

Firstly, it broadens their perspective and helps them develop cultural awareness and tolerance. When you experience different ways of life firsthand, you realize that there are many valid approaches to living and solving problems. This makes you more open-minded and less judgmental. Secondly, international travel builds independence and confidence. Navigating unfamiliar places, dealing with language barriers, and adapting to new situations all help young people develop problem-solving skills and self-reliance. Finally, travel can be educational in ways that classroom learning cannot match. Seeing historical sites, experiencing different political systems, or observing different economic conditions provides real-world context for academic knowledge. While travel can be expensive, I believe the personal growth and education it provides make it a worthwhile investment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

First, cooking is an essential life skill that promotes independence and self-sufficiency. When children learn to cook early, they develop the confidence and ability to take care of themselves as they grow up. This is particularly important when they leave home for college or start living independently. Without basic cooking skills, young adults often rely heavily on expensive and unhealthy fast food. Second, cooking together creates valuable bonding opportunities between children and their families. When I was young, some of my best memories were made helping my grandmother prepare traditional family recipes.

Explain your view.\n\nStudent Response: I do not think people should always follow rules they believe are unfair. My first reason is that progress often depends on challenging unjust rules. Throughout history, positive social changes have occurred when people peacefully questioned unfair laws and regulations. For example, the civil rights movement in the United States challenged discriminatory laws, leading to greater equality and justice. If everyone had simply followed unfair rules, these important improvements would never have happened. However, I believe rule-breaking should be done thoughtfully and non-violently, with consideration of consequences and a genuine commitment to improving society. People should also be prepared to accept legal consequences for their actions. The key is distinguishing between rules that serve the common good versus those that perpetuate injustice or harm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

This shared excitement is something a recording simply cannot capture. Secondly, the performance itself is unique.

The main advantage is that it provides a convenient form of entertainment and relaxation for students. After a long day of classes, watching a show could be a good way to unwind. However, the biggest disadvantage is that television can be a major distraction from academic work. Students might be tempted to watch TV instead of studying, which could negatively impact their grades. Another disadvantage is that it can increase social isolation.

When I travel to different locations, I can compare and contrast these experiences, which gives me a broader understanding of the world. For example, during a recent trip to Europe, I visited both Paris and Rome, and experiencing both cities helped me appreciate the distinct differences in French and Italian culture.

Firstly, teamwork brings together diverse skills, perspectives, and experiences that can lead to more creative and comprehensive solutions. When people with different backgrounds collaborate, they can spot problems and opportunities that individuals might miss. For example, in my experience with group projects, the final result was usually much stronger than what any of us could have achieved alone. Secondly, working in teams helps develop important interpersonal skills like communication, compromise, and leadership. These skills are valuable not just professionally but in all areas of life. Finally, teams can provide motivation and accountability that help maintain momentum on long-term projects. However, I do appreciate that working alone allows for deep focus and can be more efficient for certain tasks that require sustained concentration. I think the ideal approach is being comfortable with both individual and collaborative work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

I love it for two primary reasons. First, I am captivated by the fast pace and constant action of the game. Unlike some sports where there can be long periods without much happening, basketball is continuously dynamic with quick transitions between offense and defense, strategic plays, and moments of athletic brilliance. The 24-second shot clock ensures that the pace never slows down, making every second crucial and exciting to watch. Second, basketball perfectly combines individual skill with teamwork in a way that creates beautiful, coordinated plays. A successful team needs players who can excel individually â€“ whether in shooting, passing, or defense â€“ but they must also work together seamlessly, reading each other's movements and creating opportunities for teammates. This balance makes it endlessly fascinating to both play and watch."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Many people are trying to manage their weight, control diabetes, or follow specific dietary requirements, and having access to calorie counts, sodium levels, and ingredient lists allows them to make informed decisions about what they eat.

The fundamental purpose of a university is to expose students to different ideas and encourage critical thinking, even when those ideas are controversial or uncomfortable.

By engaging with viewpoints they disagree with, students learn to construct better arguments and understand complex issues more deeply.

Right now, many talented students can't afford college and miss out on higher education, which perpetuates social and economic inequality. Free education would ensure that a person's potential, not their family's wealth, determines their educational opportunities. Secondly, society as a whole benefits when more people are educated. Countries with higher education levels tend to have stronger economies, better healthcare systems, and more innovation. The investment in free education would pay for itself through increased tax revenue from higher-earning graduates and reduced social costs.

(1) giving a presentation (2) writing a paper (3) creating a video\n\nStudent Response: For my final project, I would choose to create a video. Firstly, creating a video allows for more creative expression and multimedia integration than traditional presentations or papers. I can combine visual elements, audio, graphics, and narrative to create a more engaging and memorable learning experience. This format enables me to demonstrate concepts through animations, include expert interviews, and show real-world examples that would be impossible to convey effectively through text alone. Secondly, video creation develops highly relevant digital literacy skills that are increasingly valuable in today's workplace. Learning video editing, storytelling techniques, and digital media production gives me practical experience with tools and methods that employers across many fields now expect. Unlike papers, which primarily develop writing skills, or presentations, which focus on speaking abilities, video projects require technical proficiency that enhances my overall skillset and makes me more competitive in the job market."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.

Politics b. Sports c. Arts and films\n\nStudent Response: I most like to read about arts and films. My first reason is that it's a source of joy and inspiration. Reading reviews of new movies or learning about artistic movements helps me discover new forms of creative expression and broadens my cultural understanding. Unlike politics, which can be depressing or divisive, arts coverage usually focuses on human creativity and achievement. The second reason is that arts and film content is more timeless and personally enriching. While political news becomes outdated quickly and sports results are forgotten, knowledge about films and artistic movements stays relevant and contributes to my personal growth and cultural literacy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Score: 4\n\nThis response fulfills the task demands excellently with sustained, coherent discourse.
