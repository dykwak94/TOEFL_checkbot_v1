Scoring Criteria:
- Score 4: Fulfills task demands with sustained, coherent discourse. Well-paced delivery, effective grammar/vocabulary, well-developed and coherent ideas.
- Score 3: Addresses task appropriately but may lack full development. Generally clear speech with some fluency, fairly effective language use, mostly coherent with some limitations.
- Score 2: Addresses task but limited development. Intelligible speech requiring listener effort, limited grammar/vocabulary range, basic ideas with limited elaboration.
- Score 1: Very limited content/coherence, largely unintelligible speech, severely limited language control, lacks substance beyond basic ideas.
- Score 0: No attempt or unrelated to topic.

Provide your score and a brief explanation focusing on delivery, language use, and topic development."""
